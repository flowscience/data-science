# Data Science & Gene Expression Tools
Assorted scripts for file parsing and statistical analysis. Written for processing gene expression and related data while I was in grad school - many of these scripts are applicable to common problems entirely unrelated to biology. Need to parse a list by another list? How about parsing a dictionary based on X# separate text files each containing a list? I gotchu.

The Python folder is almost entirely data preprocessing and parsing scripts.
The R folder is almost entirely statistical analyses scrips.

I still use these for random things, but the library is largely unmaintained. Please feel free to leave an issue or comment if you have suggestions to improve this repo or other ideas to contribute.
